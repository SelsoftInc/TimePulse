## File Format Guidelines

### For Best Results with Images
- **Resolution**: Use high-resolution images (at least 1200x800 pixels)
- **Lighting**: Ensure good lighting, avoid shadows
- **Orientation**: Keep the document straight (not tilted)
- **Clarity**: Avoid blurry images
- **Format**: Use a clear, structured timesheet format
- **Text**: Ensure text is legible and not handwritten

### For Best Results with PDFs
- **Text-based PDFs**: Work better than scanned PDFs
- **Structure**: Use tables or clear sections
- **Labels**: Include clear labels like "Day", "Hours", "Employee Name"

### For Best Results with Excel/CSV
- **Headers**: Include column headers (Day, Hours, etc.)
- **Format**: Use standard day names (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- **Data Types**: Use numbers for hours (not text)
- **Structure**: One row per day or clear tabular format

### For Best Results with Word Documents
- **Tables**: Use tables for timesheet data
- **Labels**: Include clear field labels
- **Format**: Use standard formatting (not complex layouts)

## Expected Timesheet Format

The AI engine works best with timesheets that include:

```
Employee Name: John Doe
Client: Cognizant
Project: Web Development
Week: 01/15/2024 to 01/21/2024

Day         Hours
Monday      8
Tuesday     8
Wednesday   7.5
Thursday    8
Friday      8
Saturday    0
Sunday      0

Total Hours: 39.5
```

## Extraction Methods by File Type

### Image Files (JPG, PNG, HEIC, BMP, WEBP)
1. **Preprocessing**: Image is loaded and prepared
2. **OCR**: Tesseract.js extracts text from the image
3. **Parsing**: Text is analyzed for timesheet patterns
4. **Extraction**: Hours, names, and dates are identified
5. **Confidence**: Based on OCR quality and pattern matching

### PDF Files
1. **Text Extraction**: pdfjs-dist extracts embedded text
2. **Parsing**: Text is analyzed for timesheet patterns
3. **Extraction**: Data points are identified
4. **Confidence**: Based on text structure and completeness

### Excel/CSV Files
1. **Parsing**: xlsx library reads spreadsheet data
2. **Header Detection**: Identifies column headers
3. **Data Mapping**: Maps columns to timesheet fields
4. **Extraction**: Reads values from cells
5. **Confidence**: High (structured data)

### Word Documents (DOC, DOCX)
1. **Conversion**: mammoth.js converts to text
2. **Fallback**: Basic text extraction if mammoth unavailable
3. **Parsing**: Text is analyzed for patterns
4. **Extraction**: Data points are identified
5. **Confidence**: Based on document structure

## Troubleshooting

### Low Confidence Score
- **Try a different format**: Convert to Excel or PDF
- **Improve image quality**: Use better lighting, higher resolution
- **Use structured format**: Tables work better than free text
- **Check labels**: Ensure clear field labels are present

### No Hours Extracted
- **Check format**: Ensure hours are clearly labeled
- **Use numbers**: Avoid text like "eight hours" (use "8")
- **Table structure**: Use tables or clear sections
- **Day names**: Use standard day names (Mon, Tue, etc.)

### Wrong Data Extracted
- **Review format**: Ensure timesheet follows expected structure
- **Clear labels**: Use explicit labels (Employee Name:, Hours:, etc.)
- **Avoid clutter**: Remove unnecessary text or graphics
- **Standard layout**: Use a simple, clear layout

### File Upload Fails
- **Check file size**: Must be under 10MB
- **Check format**: Must be a supported file type
- **Check permissions**: Ensure file is not corrupted or locked
- **Try different format**: Convert to a different supported format

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
```json
{

## Best Practices

1. **Use Consistent Formats**: Stick to one timesheet template
2. **High Quality Files**: Use clear, high-resolution files
3. **Structured Data**: Use tables and clear sections
4. **Standard Labels**: Use common field names
5. **Verify Data**: Always review extracted data before submission
6. **Test First**: Try with a sample file first
7. **Backup Manual Entry**: Keep manual entry as fallback
