# Cascade Delete Implementation

## Overview
Implemented cascading deletes to ensure when an employee is deleted, all their related data is also removed from the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Employee Delete Route (`/server/routes/employees.js`)

**Before**: Only deleted the employee record

**After**: Deletes employee AND all related data:
- Timesheets
- Invoices
- (Future: Leave requests, performance reviews, documents, etc.)

### Implementation

```javascript
router.delete('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  // 1. Find employee
  // 2. Delete all timesheets for this employee
  // 3. Delete all invoices for this employee
  // 4. Delete the employee
  // 5. Return summary of deleted records
});
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Employee and all related data deleted successfully",
  "deletedRecords": {
    "timesheets": 5,
    "invoices": 3
  }
}
```

## Tables with Employee References

Current tables that reference employees:

1. **employees** - Main employee table
   - Column: `employee_id` (primary key)

2. **timesheets** - Employee timesheet records
   - Column: `employee_id` (foreign key)
   - **Action**: CASCADE DELETE implemented ✅

3. **invoices** - Employee invoices
   - Column: `employee_id` (foreign key)
   - **Action**: CASCADE DELETE implemented ✅

4. **onboarding_logs** - Onboarding tracking
   - Column: `employees_created`
   - **Action**: Not deleted (historical record)

## Leave Management Data

**Current Status**: Leave data is **mock data** (not in database)

When you delete employees:
- ✅ Mock leave requests for deleted employees are removed
- ✅ Leave approvals screen will show "No Pending Approvals"

**Future**: When leave requests table is created, add to cascade delete:
```javascript
// Delete leave requests
if (models.LeaveRequest) {
  const leaveRequestsDeleted = await models.LeaveRequest.destroy({
    where: { employeeId: id, tenantId }
  });
  deletedRecords.leaveRequests = leaveRequestsDeleted;
}
```

## Testing

### Test Employee Deletion

1. **Via API**:
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:5001/api/employees/{employeeId}?tenantId={tenantId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

2. **Via Frontend**:
- Go to Employees page
- Click delete on an employee
- Confirm deletion

### Expected Results

✅ Employee record deleted
✅ All timesheets for that employee deleted
✅ All invoices for that employee deleted
✅ Response shows count of deleted records
✅ Employee no longer appears in:
- Employee list
- Timesheet approvals
- Leave approvals
- Invoice lists
- Any other employee-related screens

## Database Integrity

### Foreign Key Constraints

**Recommendation**: Add foreign key constraints with CASCADE DELETE at database level:

```sql
ALTER TABLE timesheets 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_employee_timesheets 
FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) 
REFERENCES employees(id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE invoices 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_employee_invoices 
FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) 
REFERENCES employees(id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

This ensures data integrity even if delete is done directly in database.

## Soft Delete Alternative

For audit purposes, consider implementing **soft delete** instead:

```javascript
// Instead of destroying, mark as deleted
await employee.update({ 
  status: 'deleted',
  deletedAt: new Date(),
  deletedBy: managerId 
});

// Hide deleted employees in queries
where: { 
  tenantId,
  status: { [Op.ne]: 'deleted' }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Maintain historical records
- Can restore if deleted by mistake
- Audit trail of who deleted and when
- Keep referential integrity

## Future Enhancements

When adding new tables that reference employees:

1. **Add to cascade delete logic**:
```javascript
// Delete performance reviews
if (models.PerformanceReview) {
  const reviewsDeleted = await models.PerformanceReview.destroy({
    where: { employeeId: id, tenantId }
  });
  deletedRecords.performanceReviews = reviewsDeleted;
}
```

2. **Update deletedRecords object**
3. **Test thoroughly**

## Summary

✅ **Implemented**: Cascade delete for timesheets and invoices
✅ **Updated**: Mock leave data to exclude deleted employees
✅ **Response**: Returns count of deleted records
✅ **Safe**: Only deletes within same tenant
✅ **Ready**: For future leave requests table

When you delete an employee now, all their data is properly cleaned up across the system!
