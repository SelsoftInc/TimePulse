# ✅ Employee Dashboard Redirect Fixed

## Issue
When employees logged in, they were seeing the generic admin/manager dashboard (Image 1) instead of the employee-specific dashboard (Image 2).

## Solution Applied

### Updated: `Dashboard.jsx`

**Uncommented and enhanced the employee redirect logic:**

```javascript
const Dashboard = () => {
  const { currentEmployer, user } = useAuth();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const { subdomain } = useParams();

  // Redirect employees to their dedicated dashboard
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Dashboard - Checking user role for redirect');
    console.log('  user.role:', user?.role);
    console.log('  currentEmployer.role:', currentEmployer?.role);
    
    // Check both user.role and currentEmployer.role
    const userRole = user?.role || currentEmployer?.role;
    
    // Only redirect if user is ONLY an employee (not admin or approver)
    if (userRole === "employee") {
      console.log('✅ Redirecting employee to employee-dashboard');
      navigate(`/${subdomain}/employee-dashboard`, { replace: true });
    }
  }, [currentEmployer, user, navigate, subdomain]);
  
  // Rest of dashboard code...
};
```

## What This Does

### Before (Broken)
```
Employee logs in
  ↓
Navigates to /{subdomain}/dashboard
  ↓
Shows generic dashboard (Image 1)
  ❌ Wrong dashboard!
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Employee logs in
  ↓
Navigates to /{subdomain}/dashboard
  ↓
useEffect detects role = "employee"
  ↓
Automatically redirects to /{subdomain}/employee-dashboard
  ↓
Shows employee-specific dashboard (Image 2)
  ✅ Correct dashboard!
```

## Employee Dashboard Features (Image 2)

The employee dashboard shows:
- **Total Hours**: Current week and month hours
- **Pending Timesheets**: Count with trend
- **Approved Timesheets**: Count with trend
- **Overdue Timesheets**: Count with trend
- **Recent Timesheets**: Table with project, client, week, hours, status
- **Your Hours Summary**: This week vs this month
- **Timesheet Status**: Current week vs last week (Pending/Approved)
- **Add Timesheet Button**: Quick access to submit new timesheet

## Admin/Manager Dashboard (Image 1)

Admins and managers will still see:
- Welcome message
- Hours this week/month
- Pending/Approved counts
- Recent timesheets
- Hours breakdown
- Team overview

## Role Detection

The redirect checks both:
1. `user.role` - From the user object
2. `currentEmployer.role` - From the employer context

**Priority**: `user.role` is checked first, then falls back to `currentEmployer.role`

## Testing

### Test as Employee
1. Login as Selvakumar (employee)
2. Should automatically go to employee dashboard
3. Check console for: `✅ Redirecting employee to employee-dashboard`

### Test as Admin
1. Login as Pushban (admin)
2. Should stay on admin dashboard
3. No redirect should occur

### Test as Manager
1. Login as manager user
2. Should stay on manager dashboard
3. No redirect should occur

## Console Logs

When employee logs in, you'll see:
```
Dashboard - Checking user role for redirect
  user.role: employee
  currentEmployer.role: employee
✅ Redirecting employee to employee-dashboard
```

When admin logs in, you'll see:
```
Dashboard - Checking user role for redirect
  user.role: admin
  currentEmployer.role: admin
(No redirect - stays on admin dashboard)
```

## Routes

- **Admin/Manager**: `/{subdomain}/dashboard` → Shows generic dashboard
- **Employee**: `/{subdomain}/dashboard` → Auto-redirects to `/{subdomain}/employee-dashboard`

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Better UX**: Employees see relevant information immediately
2. ✅ **Role-based UI**: Each role sees appropriate dashboard
3. ✅ **Automatic**: No manual navigation needed
4. ✅ **Clean URLs**: Uses replace: true to avoid back button issues
5. ✅ **Console Logging**: Easy to debug role detection

## Summary

✅ **Employee redirect enabled** in Dashboard.jsx  
✅ **Role detection** checks both user and currentEmployer  
✅ **Automatic navigation** to employee-specific dashboard  
✅ **Console logging** for debugging  
✅ **Clean redirect** with replace: true

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Action Required**: Refresh frontend and test login  
**Expected Result**: Employees see employee dashboard automatically
