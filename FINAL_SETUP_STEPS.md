# 🚀 Final Setup Steps - Timesheet Display Fix

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Backend Changes**
- ✅ Added `employeeId` to login API response (`server/routes/auth.js`)
- ✅ Created new API endpoint: `GET /api/timesheets/employee/:employeeId/all`
- ✅ Updated TimesheetSummary to fetch real data from database

### 2. **Frontend Changes**
- ✅ Updated `Login.jsx` to store `employeeId` in user info
- ✅ Updated `TimesheetSummary.jsx` to use real API instead of dummy data
- ✅ Added proper error handling and loading states

### 3. **Database Schema**
- ✅ Script created to add missing columns (notes, attachments, reviewer_id, etc.)

## 🎯 Run These Commands

### Step 1: Add Missing Database Columns
```bash
cd server
node scripts/complete-setup.js
```

This will:
- Add all missing columns to timesheets table
- Link Selvakumar user to employee record
- Create a test timesheet (Sep 29 - Oct 05, 2025)
- Assign Pushban as reviewer
- Set status to "submitted"

### Step 2: Restart Backend Server
Stop and restart your backend server to load the updated code:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test the Login
1. **Logout** from current session (if logged in)
2. **Login again** as: `selvakumar@selsoftinc.com`
   - This will fetch the `employeeId` from the updated login API
3. Navigate to **Timesheets** page
4. You should see the timesheet!

## 📋 What Should Happen

### Employee View (Selvakumar):
- **Timesheets Page** shows:
  - Week Range: "29 SEP, 2025 To 05 OCT, 2025"
  - Status: "Submitted for Approval"
  - Hours: 40.00
  - Total: 1 timesheet

### Admin View (Pushban):
- **Timesheet Approval Page** shows:
  - Selvakumar's pending timesheet
  - Can click "Review" to approve/reject
  - After approval, status changes to "Approved"

### After Approval:
- Login as Selvakumar again
- Timesheet status changes to "Approved"

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still showing "0 of 0 items"
**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you ran `node scripts/complete-setup.js`
2. Restart the backend server
3. **Logout and login again** (important!)
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify API is being called: Open DevTools → Network tab → Look for `/api/timesheets/employee/...` call

### Issue: API returns empty array
**Check:**
1. User has `employeeId` in localStorage:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('userInfo'))
   // Should show: { ..., employeeId: "some-uuid" }
   ```
2. Timesheet exists in database (run check script)

### Issue: Cannot find employee
**Solution:**
- The complete-setup script links user to employee automatically
- If still failing, check that email matches in both users and employees tables

## 📊 API Endpoints

### 1. Login (Updated)
```
POST /api/auth/login
Response includes: { user: { ..., employeeId: "uuid" } }
```

### 2. Get Employee Timesheets (New)
```
GET /api/timesheets/employee/:employeeId/all?tenantId=xxx
Returns: All timesheets for the employee
```

### 3. Get Pending Approvals
```
GET /api/timesheets/pending-approval?tenantId=xxx&reviewerId=xxx
Returns: Timesheets pending approval
```

## ✨ Complete Workflow

1. **Employee submits timesheet**:
   - Fills hours, selects reviewer
   - Status: "submitted"
   - Appears in admin's approval queue

2. **Admin reviews**:
   - Sees timesheet in "Timesheet Approval" page
   - Clicks "Review"
   - Approves or rejects with comments

3. **Status updates**:
   - If approved: Status → "approved"
   - If rejected: Status → "rejected" with reason
   - Employee sees updated status

## 🎉 Success Criteria

After completing all steps, you should see:
- ✅ Timesheet list loads (not "0 of 0 items")
- ✅ Shows real data from database
- ✅ Week range formatted correctly
- ✅ Status shows "Submitted for Approval"
- ✅ Hours display correctly (40.00)
- ✅ Can click to view details
- ✅ Admin can approve/reject
- ✅ Status updates after approval

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Must logout and login again** after backend changes
2. **employeeId is critical** - without it, API won't work
3. **Run complete-setup.js** before testing
4. **Restart backend server** after code changes
