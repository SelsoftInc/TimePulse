## 💡 What Still Exists (Not Deleted)

The following files remain unchanged and can be re-enabled later:
- `frontend/src/components/settings/IntegrationSettings.jsx` - Integration page component
- All integration-related code is preserved
- All imports and functionality are intact, just commented out

## 🔄 How to Re-enable the Integration Tab

To restore the Integration tab in the future, simply uncomment the three sections:

### **Step 1: Uncomment the import**
```javascript
import IntegrationSettings from "./IntegrationSettings";
```

### **Step 2: Uncomment the case statement**
```javascript
case "integrations":
  return <IntegrationSettings />;
```

### **Step 3: Uncomment the menu item**
```javascript
<li className={activeTab === "integrations" ? "active" : ""}>

  </button>

```

## 🐛 Bonus Fixes Applied

During this update, also fixed typos in two other files:

### **1. VendorList.jsx**
- Fixed: `card-inne` → `card-inner`

### **2. ClientsList.jsx**
- Fixed: `card-inne` → `card-inner`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **No Functionality Lost:** The IntegrationSettings component still exists and is fully functional
2. **Easy Restoration:** Simply uncomment the 3 sections to restore the tab
3. **No Breaking Changes:** The application continues to work normally without the Integration tab
4. **Clean Code:** Used proper comment syntax (JavaScript multi-line `/* */` and JSX `{/* */}`)
