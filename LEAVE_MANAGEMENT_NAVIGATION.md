# Leave Management Navigation Implementation

## Overview
Added "Leave Management" to the left sidebar navigation with proper routing to the Leave Management screen.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sidebar Navigation (`/frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`)

**Added**:
```jsx
<li className="sidebar-item">
  <Link
    to={`/${currentSubdomain}/leave-management`}
    className={`sidebar-link ${
      currentPath.includes(`/${currentSubdomain}/leave-management`)
        ? "active"
        : ""
    }`}
  >
    <div className="sidebar-icon">
      <i className="fa fa-calendar-alt"></i>
    </div>
    {!collapsed && <span className="sidebar-text">Leave Management</span>}
  </Link>
</li>
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Calendar icon (fa-calendar-alt)
- ✅ Active state highlighting
- ✅ Responsive to sidebar collapse
- ✅ Positioned between "Impl Partners" and "Reports"
- ✅ No permission guard (accessible to all authenticated users)

### 2. Route Configuration (`/frontend/src/App.js`)

**Added**:
```jsx
<Route path="/:subdomain/leave-management" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <EmployerLayout><LeaveManagement /></EmployerLayout>
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Protected route (requires authentication)
- ✅ Uses EmployerLayout for consistent UI
- ✅ Supports subdomain routing
- ✅ Kept existing `/leave` route for backward compatibility

### 3. Leave Management Component

**File**: `/frontend/src/components/leave/LeaveManagement.jsx`

**Already exists** with features:
- Leave balance tracking (Vacation, Sick, Personal)
- Leave request submission form
- Leave history view
- Pending requests management
- Mock data implementation (ready for API integration)

## Navigation Flow

1. **User clicks "Leave Management" in sidebar**
2. **Navigates to**: `http://localhost:3000/selsoft/leave-management`
3. **Component loads**: LeaveManagement.jsx
4. **Displays**:
   - Leave balance cards
   - Request leave form
   - Leave history
   - Pending requests

## Sidebar Menu Structure

```
├── Dashboard
├── Timesheets
│   └── Timesheet Approval (if has permission)
├── Invoices (if has permission)
├── Employees (if has permission)
├── Vendors (if has permission)
├── End Clients (if has permission)
├── Impl Partners (if has permission)
├── Leave Management ⭐ NEW
├── Reports (if has permission)
└── Settings (if has permission)
```

## Testing

### Test Navigation:
1. Login to the application
2. Look for "Leave Management" in the left sidebar (with calendar icon)
3. Click on "Leave Management"
4. **Expected**: Navigate to leave management screen
5. **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/selsoft/leave-management`

### Test Active State:
1. Navigate to Leave Management
2. **Expected**: Menu item is highlighted/active
3. Click on another menu item
4. **Expected**: Leave Management is no longer highlighted

### Test Sidebar Collapse:
1. Click the collapse button on sidebar
2. **Expected**: Only calendar icon visible
3. Hover over icon
4. **Expected**: Tooltip or expanded state shows "Leave Management"

## Features of Leave Management Screen

### Leave Balance Cards
- **Vacation**: Total, Used, Pending, Remaining
- **Sick Leave**: Total, Used, Pending, Remaining  
- **Personal**: Total, Used, Pending, Remaining

### Request Leave Form
- Leave Type dropdown (Vacation, Sick, Personal, Other)
- Start Date picker
- End Date picker
- Reason text area
- Attachment upload
- Submit button

### Leave History
- Past leave requests
- Status (Approved, Rejected, Pending)
- Dates and duration
- Reason/notes

### Pending Requests
- Requests awaiting approval
- Ability to cancel pending requests

## API Integration (Future)

The component is ready for API integration. To connect to backend:

1. Create backend API endpoints:
   - `GET /api/leave/balance` - Get leave balance
   - `GET /api/leave/history` - Get leave history
   - `POST /api/leave/request` - Submit leave request
   - `GET /api/leave/pending` - Get pending requests
   - `DELETE /api/leave/:id` - Cancel leave request

2. Replace mock data in `LeaveManagement.jsx` with API calls

3. Add authentication headers to requests

## Styling

The component uses existing TimePulse styles and follows the design system:
- Consistent card layouts
- Color-coded status badges
- Responsive grid system
- Dark mode compatible

## Access Control

Currently:
- ✅ Available to all authenticated users
- ✅ No specific permission required

To add permission control (if needed):
```jsx
<PermissionGuard requiredPermission={PERMISSIONS.VIEW_LEAVE} fallback={null}>
  <li className="sidebar-item">
    {/* Leave Management link */}
  </li>
</PermissionGuard>
```

## Success Criteria

✅ "Leave Management" appears in left sidebar
✅ Calendar icon is displayed
✅ Clicking navigates to leave management screen
✅ Active state highlights when on the page
✅ Works with sidebar collapse
✅ Route is protected (requires authentication)
✅ Component loads without errors

## Summary

The Leave Management navigation is now fully functional and integrated into the TimePulse application. Users can easily access the leave management features from the sidebar navigation.
