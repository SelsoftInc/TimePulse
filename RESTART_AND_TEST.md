# 🚀 RESTART AND TEST - Final Solution

## Current Situation:
- ✅ Database has timesheet data (verified)
- ✅ Routes are fixed in code
- ❌ Server is running OLD code (needs restart)

## 🔧 Steps to Fix:

### 1. **Stop the Backend Server**
Find the terminal/command prompt running the backend server and press **Ctrl+C**

### 2. **Start Backend Server**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

Wait for these messages:
```
✅ Database connection established successfully
🚀 TimePulse Server running on port 5001
```

### 3. **Test the Routes**

Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
# Test 1: Employee lookup
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/timesheets/employees/by-email/selvakumar@selsoftinc.com?tenantId=5eda5596-b1d9-4963-953d-7af9d0511ce8"

# Expected: {"success":true,"employee":{"id":"5c1982f0-bf32-4945-b6a6-b3eaf5a27cb3",...}}

# Test 2: Pending approvals
curl "http://localhost:5001/api/timesheets/pending-approval?tenantId=5eda5596-b1d9-4963-953d-7af9d0511ce8"

# Expected: {"success":true,"timesheets":[{...}]}
```

### 4. **Refresh Browser**

**For Employee View (Selvakumar):**
1. Logout if logged in
2. Login as: `selvakumar@selsoftinc.com`
3. Go to: **Timesheets** page
4. Should see: 1 timesheet (Sep 29 - Oct 05, 2025)

**For Admin View (Pushban):**
1. Logout if logged in
2. Login as: `pushban@selsoftinc.com`
3. Go to: **Timesheet Approval** page
4. Should see: 1 pending timesheet from Selvakumar

## 📋 What Was Fixed:

### Backend Routes (timesheets.js):
1. ✅ Added `/employees/by-email/:email` route at line 33 (BEFORE `/:id`)
2. ✅ Moved `/pending-approval` route to line 146 (BEFORE `/:id` at line 214)
3. ✅ Removed duplicate routes
4. ✅ Fixed route order to prevent conflicts

### Frontend (TimesheetSummary.jsx):
1. ✅ Always fetches employee by email first
2. ✅ Then uses employeeId to fetch timesheets
3. ✅ Added comprehensive console logging

### Database:
1. ✅ Timesheet exists: ID `2e5c56e2-75c3-4f84-ba55-6fc6e34c21f9`
2. ✅ Status: `submitted`
3. ✅ Hours: 40
4. ✅ Week: Sep 29 - Oct 05, 2025
5. ✅ Employee: Selvakumar Murugesan
6. ✅ Reviewer: Pushban User

## 🔍 If Still Not Working:

### Check Browser Console (F12):
Look for these logs:
```
🔍 Loading timesheets... { tenantId: "...", userEmail: "selvakumar@selsoftinc.com" }
📡 Fetching employee by email...
✅ Got employeeId: 5c1982f0-bf32-4945-b6a6-b3eaf5a27cb3
📡 Calling API: /api/timesheets/employee/5c1982f0-bf32-4945-b6a6-b3eaf5a27cb3/all?tenantId=...
✅ API Response: { success: true, timesheets: [...] }
```

### If You See Errors:
- **404 on employee lookup**: Server not restarted
- **Empty timesheets array**: Check database with `node scripts/check-pending.js`
- **No tenantId**: Logout and login again

## ✅ Success Criteria:

**Employee View:**
- Shows "1 of 1 items"
