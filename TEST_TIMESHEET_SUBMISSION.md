# ✅ ROOT CAUSE FOUND - Timesheets Not Being Saved

## Issue Discovered
The database only has **1 timesheet** with status `approved`. There are **NO timesheets with status `submitted`**.

This means the 2 timesheets Selvakumar submitted were **NOT saved to the database**.

## Database Current State

```
Total timesheets: 1

Timesheets by status:
  approved: 1  ← This is the old one from the screenshot

Submitted timesheets: 0  ← THIS IS THE PROBLEM!
```

## Why Admin Sees "No Pending Timesheets"

The approval page queries:
```sql
SELECT * FROM timesheets 
WHERE tenant_id = '...' 
AND status = 'submitted'
```

**Result**: 0 timesheets (because none have status='submitted')

## Possible Causes

### 1. Submit Endpoint Not Being Called
The frontend might not be reaching the backend submit endpoint.

### 2. Submit Endpoint Failing Silently
The endpoint might be throwing an error but not showing it to the user.

### 3. Backend Server Not Running
The server might not be running or might have crashed.

### 4. Route Order Issue Still Present
The `/submit` route might be getting matched by `/:id` route.

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check if Backend is Running
```bash
# Check if server is running on port 5000
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

**Expected**: `{"status":"ok"}`

### Step 2: Check Submit Endpoint Directly
```bash
# Test the submit endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/timesheets/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tenantId": "5eda5596-b1d9-4963-953d-7af9d0511ce8",
    "employeeId": "2d639e96-2f26-4577-8ce7-2570e5ca0ad0",
    "weekStart": "2025-10-06",
    "weekEnd": "2025-10-12",
    "clientId": "a3889c22-ace2-40f9-9f29-1a1556c0a444",
    "reviewerId": "e70433fd-c849-4433-b4bd-7588476adfd3",
    "status": "submitted",
    "totalHours": 40,
    "dailyHours": {"sat":0,"sun":0,"mon":8,"tue":8,"wed":8,"thu":8,"fri":8},
    "notes": "Test submission"
  }'
```

**Expected**: `{"success":true,"message":"Timesheet submitted successfully"}`

### Step 3: Check Frontend Console
When submitting timesheet, check browser console (F12) for:
```
📤 Submitting timesheet with approver: ...
📤 Submitting to API: {...}
✅ API Response: {...}
```

### Step 4: Check Backend Console
When submitting, backend should log:
```
📥 Received timesheet submission: {...}
✅ Created new timesheet: uuid-123
```

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd d:\selsoft\WebApp\TimePulse\server
npm start
```

**Wait for**:
```
Server running on port 5000
✅ Database connection established successfully
```

### 2. Check Route Order
Verify `/submit` route comes BEFORE `/:id` route in `server/routes/timesheets.js`

### 3. Test Submission
1. Open frontend
2. Fill timesheet
3. Select approver
4. Click Submit
5. Check console for errors

### 4. Verify Database
After submission, run:
```bash
node scripts/check-submitted-timesheets.js
```

Should show new timesheet with status='submitted'

## Expected Flow

```
User clicks Submit
  ↓
Frontend: POST /api/timesheets/submit
  ↓
Backend: Receives request
  ↓
Backend: Logs "📥 Received timesheet submission"
  ↓
Backend: Saves to database with status='submitted'
  ↓
Backend: Logs "✅ Created new timesheet"
  ↓
Backend: Returns success response
  ↓
Frontend: Shows success message
  ↓
Frontend: Redirects to summary
  ↓
Admin: Sees timesheet in pending approvals
```

## Current Flow (Broken)

```
User clicks Submit
  ↓
Frontend: POST /api/timesheets/submit
  ↓
❌ Request fails OR endpoint not reached
  ↓
No database save
  ↓
Admin sees: "No Pending Timesheets"
```

## Next Steps

1. **START BACKEND SERVER** (if not running)
2. **CHECK BACKEND CONSOLE** for errors
3. **TEST SUBMISSION** with console open
4. **SHARE CONSOLE LOGS** if still failing

---

**The timesheets are not being saved to the database. We need to verify the backend server is running and the submit endpoint is working.**
