# Timesheet Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

### **1. Database Table Created**
- **File:** `server/database/migrations/2025-09-30_create_timesheets_table.sql`
- **Table:** `timesheets` with full schema including:
  - UUID primary key
  - Tenant/Employee/Client foreign keys
  - Week range (Monday-Sunday)
  - Daily hours as JSONB
  - Status workflow (draft, submitted, approved, rejected)
  - Notes and attachments
  - Approval tracking fields
  - Proper indexes and constraints

### **2. Sequelize Model Updated**
- **File:** `server/models/index.js`
- **Added fields:**
  - `notes` (TEXT)
  - `attachments` (JSONB)
  - `submittedAt` (DATE)
  - `approvedAt` (DATE)
  - `approvedBy` (UUID foreign key)
  - `rejectionReason` (TEXT)

### **3. Backend API Enhanced**
- **File:** `server/routes/timesheets.js`
- **New endpoint:** `GET /api/timesheets/employee/:employeeId/current`
  - Fetches or creates timesheet for current week
  - Returns employee and client data
  - Auto-calculates week label
- **Enhanced endpoint:** `PUT /api/timesheets/:id`
  - Supports notes and attachments
  - Tracks submission and approval timestamps
  - Validates and calculates total hours

### **4. Frontend Completely Refactored**
- **File:** `frontend/src/components/timesheets/EmployeeTimesheet.jsx`

**Removed:**
- ❌ All mock employee data
- ❌ All mock SOW data
- ❌ Hardcoded week strings
- ❌ Alert-based submission

**Added:**
- ✅ Real API integration with `apiFetch`
- ✅ Loading states with spinner
- ✅ Error handling with toast notifications
- ✅ Auto-fetch on component mount
- ✅ Status-based UI (draft/submitted/approved)
- ✅ Disabled inputs for submitted timesheets
- ✅ Validation (requires hours > 0 to submit)
- ✅ Proper async form submission
- ✅ Employee and client data from database

### **5. Migration Script Created**
- **File:** `server/scripts/migrate-timesheets.js`
- **Purpose:** Easy one-command migration execution
- **Usage:** `node scripts/migrate-timesheets.js`

### **6. Comprehensive Documentation**
- **File:** `TIMESHEET_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Includes schema details, API docs, testing checklist, troubleshooting

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Weekly Cycle:**
1. Week runs Monday-Sunday
2. Backend calculates current week automatically
3. Timesheet auto-created on first access
4. One timesheet per employee per week (enforced by unique constraint)

### **User Flow:**
1. Employee opens timesheet screen
2. System fetches current week's timesheet (creates if new)
3. Employee enters hours for each day
4. Employee can:
   - **Save Draft**: Saves without submitting
   - **Submit for Approval**: Locks timesheet and sends for approval
5. Once submitted, timesheet becomes read-only

### **Data Structure:**
```javascript
dailyHours: {
  mon: 8,
  tue: 8,
  wed: 8,
  thu: 8,
  fri: 8,
  sat: 0,
  sun: 0
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **1. Run Migration:**
```bash
cd server
node scripts/migrate-timesheets.js
```

### **2. Restart Backend:**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### **3. Test Frontend:**
1. Navigate to employee timesheet screen
2. Verify data loads from database
3. Enter hours and save draft
4. Submit for approval
5. Verify status changes

### **4. Verify Database:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM timesheets;
```
