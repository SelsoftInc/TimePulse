# ✅ Week Change AI Card Fix - Complete

## 🔧 Issue Fixed

### Problem: AI Extraction Card Persists When Changing Week ✅

**Issue**: When user selects a different week from the dropdown (especially read-only weeks), the AI Extraction Complete card remains visible even though it's not relevant to the new week.

**Root Cause**: The `aiProcessedData` state was not being cleared when the week selection changed.

---

## 💡 Solution Implemented

Added code to clear AI processed data when week changes:

```javascript
const handleWeekChange = (selectedWeekValue) => {
  setSelectedWeek(selectedWeekValue);
  setWeek(selectedWeekValue);

  // Clear AI processed data when week changes
  setAiProcessedData(null);
  setShowAiUpload(false);

  // Check if selected week is read-only
  const selectedWeekData = availableWeeks.find(
    (w) => w.value === selectedWeekValue
  );
  // ... rest of the logic
};
```

## 🎯 What Happens Now

### When User Changes Week:

1. **Week Selection Updates**: New week is selected
2. **AI Data Cleared**: `setAiProcessedData(null)` removes the extraction card
3. **Upload Section Hidden**: `setShowAiUpload(false)` collapses the upload section
4. **Form Resets**: Hours and notes are cleared (for non-read-only weeks)
5. **Clean State**: User sees fresh form for the new week

---

## ✅ Behavior

### Scenario 1: Change to Regular Week
```
1. User has AI extracted data showing
2. User selects different week
3. AI card disappears ✅
4. Form resets to empty
5. User can upload new timesheet for new week
```

### Scenario 2: Change to Read-Only Week
```
1. User has AI extracted data showing
2. User selects read-only week
3. AI card disappears ✅
4. Form shows existing timesheet data
5. Upload section hidden (read-only mode)
```

### Scenario 3: Switch Between Weeks
```
1. User extracts data for Week 1
2. User switches to Week 2
3. AI card clears ✅
4. User can extract new data for Week 2
5. Each week maintains independent state
```

## 🔍 Code Changes

### File Modified: `TimesheetSubmit.jsx`

**Location**: `handleWeekChange` function

**Added Lines**:
```javascript
// Clear AI processed data when week changes
setAiProcessedData(null);
setShowAiUpload(false);
```

**Why These Two Lines?**
1. `setAiProcessedData(null)` - Removes the extraction result data
2. `setShowAiUpload(false)` - Collapses the AI upload section
