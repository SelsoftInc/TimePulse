  CRITICAL: RESTART REQUIRED
========================================

The 404 error has been FIXED in the code!

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The next.config.js was proxying ALL /api/* routes to backend (port 5001),
including /api/auth/* which should be handled by NextAuth in Next.js.

WHAT WAS FIXED:
---------------
1. next.config.js - Excluded /api/auth/* from backend proxy
2. middleware.js - Added OAuth routes to public routes list
3. NextAuth route.js - Simplified configuration

YOU MUST RESTART THE SERVER:
-----------------------------
The changes to next.config.js and middleware.js require a FULL server restart.

HOW TO RESTART:
---------------

Option 1 - Use the batch file:
   Double-click: restart-server.bat

Option 2 - Manual restart:
   1. Stop current server: Press Ctrl+C in terminal
   2. Start fresh: npm run dev

Option 3 - Clean restart (if still issues):
   1. Stop server: Ctrl+C
   2. Delete .next folder
   3. Run: npm run dev

AFTER RESTART:
--------------
1. Test NextAuth API: https://goggly-casteless-torri.ngrok-free.dev/api/googleAuth/providers
   Should return JSON (not 404)

2. Test OAuth page: https://goggly-casteless-torri.ngrok-free.dev/test-oauth
   Should show environment status

3. Try Google Sign-in: https://goggly-casteless-torri.ngrok-free.dev/login
   Should redirect to Google (not 404)

IMPORTANT:
----------
- .env.local file must exist with credentials
- Backend server must be running on port 5001
- Must restart Next.js after config changes

The code is FIXED. Just restart the server!
