RESTART BACKEND SERVER NOW
==========================

1. Stop the backend server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)

2. Restart it:
   cd d:\selsoft\WebApp\TimePulse\server
   npm start

3. Wait for "Server running on port 3001"

4. Test the invoice feature again

What was fixed:
- Simplified the GET /api/invoices/:id query
- Reduced complex nested associations
- Added better error logging
- Fixed potential association conflicts

The server should now handle invoice fetching without 500 errors.
